Node Calculator Project

ðŸ›  Requirements:

    Ask the user, "What operation would you like to perform?"
    Then the user enters one of these options: "/" "*" "-" "+"
    If the user enters an invalid character, print: "That is not a valid operation" and then restart the program
    After the user enters a valid operation, ask the user, "Please enter the first number"
    The user then enters any group of numbers. If the user enters something that is not a number, print: "This is not a number" and then re-ask the question
    After a valid number is entered, ask the user, "Please enter the second number". Perform the same error handling as before
    Then create a function to perform the proper math operation and print the result as: "The result is: X" where "X" is the actual result

For example, if the user entered addition "+" and the first number was 3 and the second number was 4, the result printed would be: "The result is 7"

NOTE: Please do not use the `eval()` method - it is never recommended.
